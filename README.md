📊 Superstore Sales Data Analysis (Excel)
Imagine you are a diligent sales manager at Superstore Sales - one of Canada’s largest retail stores. You have gotten a dataset on the supermarket's sales for various regions in the country.You want to know which product subcategories are making the company more profits and which are making it heavy losses.

Activity 1:
Section 1: Basic Formatting 
Section 2: Filtering
Section 3: Report Making - I , II

Activity 2

1. High-Profit Categories 
In this section, you want to identify the most profitable product sub-categories across each region. 
Using PIVOT Table, find the top 3 most profitable Product Sub-Categories in each region. 
Optional: Compare the profit for each of the top 3 profitable product subcategories by region:
Which subcategories are profitable in most regions?
Sort the rows and columns by profit and apply Conditional Formatting. Does this throw up some exceptions?

2. Loss Making Categories
Say you want to identify the least profitable (most loss-making) product subcategories and, if needed, stop selling those product subcategories in the regions where they are the least profitable.
Find the most loss-making Product Sub-Categories across all regions
For these subcategories, identify the regions where they are the least profitable
Optional: Articulate your observations and identify any anomalies that you observe
Food for thought: People mostly buy tables and chairs together; carefully analyse the business angle of these product categories and form hypotheses to explain your observations
Note: Make each PIVOT table in different worksheets.
